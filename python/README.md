Python examples of using MIGraphX.

Note: MIGraphX supports Python 2.7 at present.
Note: Default installation of MIGraphX should set variables correctly so
      that "migraphx.so" library is found.  If not, set PYTHONPATH so that
      it includes directory with this file.  The file PYTHONPATH.src is an
      example of command to set this variable.
